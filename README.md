Gatormmunity is a social networking site and marketplace for San Francisco State University!

Among other things, Gatormmunity features a forum for discussion, a marketplace to buy and sell items, groups that users can create and invite other users to, a live chat, and direct messaging. Furthermore, groups have their own private group chat and a private group forum. \
New users must have their identity and account verified by a moderator before they can log in, so Gatormmunity is safer than anonymous marketplace websites like Craigslist.

I encourage you to explore the website by logging in with this account: \

## Technical Details 
Gatormmunity uses AWS as its server host, Ubuntu for the server, NGINX as its web server, and MySQL for the database. Express is used for its back end, and React for its front end.

Gatormmunity was created for my university's Software Engineering course in Fall 2022, where I worked in a team with 4 other students. The team's members and their roles are listed in the table below:
| Name             | GitHub Username   | Role                                   |

The `Milestones` folder holds our prototypes and the reports/writeups we wrote documenting our design, drafts, plans, progress, etc. \
The `application` folder is where our source code is. However, the server credentials and configuration files are hidden from the public.
